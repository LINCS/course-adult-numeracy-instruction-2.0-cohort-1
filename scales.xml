    <description>The scale based on the theory of separate and connected knowing. This theory describes two different ways that we can evaluate and learn about the things we see and hear.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate knowers&lt;/strong&gt; remain as objective as possible without including feelings and emotions. In a discussion with other people, they like to defend their own ideas, using logic to find holes in opponent's ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connected knowers&lt;/strong&gt; are more sensitive to other people. They are skilled at empathy and tends to listen and ask questions until they feel they can connect and "understand things from their point of view". They learn by trying to share the experiences that led to the knowledge they find in other people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
