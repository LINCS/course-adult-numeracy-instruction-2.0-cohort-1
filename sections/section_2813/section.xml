&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Adult Numeracy Instruction (ANI) 2.0!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The ANI 2.0 PD program is an intensive, evidence-based program in effective standards-aligned mathematics instruction for adults. The goal of the program is to support instructors of adult mathematics learners to teach effectively, responsively, equitably, and with attention to both mathematics content and mathematical practices. This first module of the program serves as an introduction to the program—its goals, organization, expectations, common routines, and core content. Because ANI 2.0 is a fully online program that includes both synchronous and asynchronous components, Module 1 also orients participants to the organizational and technical logistics of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitment:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This course will take roughly 7 months&amp;nbsp;to complete (50 hours). You must attend all synchronous sessions and complete all assignments and lessons to earn a certificate; all other activities are strongly recommended but not required to earn a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;After completing this program, you will be able to:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="O0"&gt;Learn about the standards for mathematics in adult education, including both the content standards and the standards for mathematical practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="O0"&gt;Understand the difference between procedural fluency and conceptual understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="O0"&gt;Understand the importance of mathematical practices, including problem solving, reasoning abstractly and quantitatively, justifying student thinking, and modeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="O0"&gt;Understand the importance of cognitively demanding mathematics tasks and their relationship to productive struggle in mathematics learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="O0"&gt;Understand that there are diverse ways for students to appropriately access mathematics content and that teaching should be equity-based, center students’ mathematical thinking, and foster students’ positive beliefs and dispositions toward mathematics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This program is composed of the following:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 1 The Big Ideas of Adult Numeracy: Foundations of the ANI 2.0 PD Program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 2 Instructional Routines and Formative Assessment Practices That Promote Positive Mathematical Identities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 3 Essential Understandings and Operations With Whole and Rational Numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 4 Essential Understandings and Applications of Algebraic Thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 5 Essential Understandings and Applications of Geometry and Measurement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 6 Essential Understandings and Applications of Data, Statistics, and Probability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
